ROVOR-reduction
===============

Pyraf, Python, etc. scripts for the Data reduction pipline for ROVOR (Remote Observatory for Variable Object Research)


This has been tested on RHEL with Python 2.6.6, Pyfits 2.3.1, numpy 1.4.1 and Django 1.4.5, getting it to run on another configuration
may require some tweaking. Django is only required for the web part, pyfits is required for the reduction.
